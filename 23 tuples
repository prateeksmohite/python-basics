#Tuples in python -- A built-in data type that lets us creat immutable sequences of values 

#tup1 = ()
# tup2 = (1,)
# tup3 = (1, 2, 3)

# tuples are immutable same as strings


tup = (1,)     # if we have a single word or digit it is compulsory to give a comma(,) to make it a tuple otherwise it will become integer or string
print(tup)     # if we have multiple words or digits there is no need of this above thing   #(1, 2, 3, 4)
print(type(tup))

tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(tup2[1:3])        # tuple slicing is same as list slicing and string slicing
