# set in python 
# set is the collection of the unordered items.
# Each element in the set must be unique & immutable.

# nums = { 1,2,3,4 }
# set2 = { 1,2,2,2 }
# repeated elements stored only once , so it resolved to {1,2}

# null_set = set ()  #empty set syntax

collection = {1,2,2,2, "hello", "world", "world", 4}     # if the numbers and words are same, then in output only once it will come 
                                                         # and there will not be a perticular order  

print(collection)
print(type(collection))
print(len(collection))          #total number of items 

# collection = {}  #empty and # this will be a dictionary
collection = set()  # now it will be a set   
print(type(collection))
