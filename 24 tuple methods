# Tuple methods 

# tup = (2, 1, 3, 1)

# tup.index( el )  #returns index of first occurrence    tup.index(1) is 1

# tup.count( el )  #counts total occurrences     tup.count(1) is 2

tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(tup.index(2))     #it gives the output value means where is number 2 located, output is 1  #2 is called element and 1 is index

tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4)
print(tup2.count(4))
